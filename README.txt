# RaLa Yoga Wordpress Theme

**IMPORTANT:**
Do not use this theme for your project. It is written for a specific brand.

## Implemented functions:

- Navigation:
> add class .cta to an item to make it click to action.

- Content:
> add your content (like colums or paragraphs) into a group item and give the group item one of these classes:
> - .content: White backed content layer with specific paddings for your content.
> - .content-heading: Primary color backed layer with a special heading design: Please add one line "Heading H1" and another line "Heading H2" into this group.

- Parallax image:
> There is a json file ready to import into the Lazy Blocks plugin. After that, you can add the Gutenberg block "Parallax Image" into your page.

- Anker links:
> There is a smooth scroll implemented for anker links.

Note: Enter classes without the . in wordpress.


## Best practise:

### Homepage

Group (.content-heading)
Group (.content)
Parallay Image
Group (.content) > 3 column

### Other pages

Group (.content-heading)
Group (.content)

### Footer

Use a 2 or 3 column widget for the footer.
